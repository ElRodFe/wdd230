                The white space rule in design recommends using enough blank spaces in a design layout.
                It means maintaining the spaces between lines of text, paragraphs, and different design elements.
                White space is extremely important in design as it acts as a glue that holds your entire design
                together. It promotes balance and harmony and guides viewers toward the focal points of your
                design.<br>
                As you can see the whatsapp home page uses effectively this white space making the page more
                readeable and giving some rest for our eyes in the process using that cream white color in the
                background.

                Contrast in web design refers to the relationship between two or more design elements,
                such as text and background that stand out in relation to one another. It is about emphasizing
                the differences between these elements rather than their similarities.<br>
                In the FamiliSearch home page we can see this reflected in the background color they use and the
                perfect contrast it gives to the color of the text doing the reading easier.

                Proximity refers to the closeness of elements in a page. Different elements in webpages
                can be grouped together to create a bigger association. Apart from being similar, the
                closeness of these elements with each other than other page elements will automatically
                be paired in the viewerâ€™s mind.<br>
                From images to texts and navigation bars to web forms, the Proximity principle applies heavily
                to web design. When you group similar content together, it creates a seamless relationship
                between the elements and delivers a better visual experience to the viewer.<br>
                In the BYU-Idaho home page we can see this principle reflected trough the position of the
                different elements in the page, images, buttons, text, everything in its proper proximity with
                each other, creating a more friendly view for the user.
