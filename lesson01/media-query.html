            <h2>1 Nephi 1:20</h2>
            <p>
                And when the Jews heard these things they were angry with him; yea, even as with the
                prophets of old, whom they had acast out, and stoned, and slain; and they also bsought his life,
                that they might take it away. But behold, I, Nephi, will show unto you that the tender cmercies of
                the Lord are over all those whom he hath chosen, because of their faith, to make them mighty even
                unto the power of deliverance.

            <p>
                Do ye exercise faith in the redemption of him who created you? Do you look forward with an eye of
                faith, and view this mortal body raised in immortality, and this corruption braised in incorruption,
                to stand before God to be judged according to the deeds which have been done in the mortal body?
